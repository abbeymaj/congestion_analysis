## Congestion Analysis

The objective of this project is to predict the traffic congestion, given the time of day, coordinates and direction. This problem is a regression problem.

## Installation

Install the project using pip. It is always recommended to use a virtual environment (for example, using anaconda) to do the installation.

This project was built using Python 3.9.

To install the project, use the following: 

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Screenshots of the Prediction Website 

There are two webpages, which the user can interact with, for the project. 

Landing Page:

This is the landing page for the project. The page provides a brief overview of the project and then allows the user to navigate to the prediction page. 

The screenshot of the Landing Page is given below:

Prediction Page:

The prediction page enables the user to select or enter information that describes coordinates and direction in order for the application to predict traffic congestion. Once the user enters the necessary information, the user must click on the "Predict" button to generate the congestion prediction.
